Thank you so much for visiting the site.  I&#8217;m filled with self-loathing so the fact that you&#8217;re interested enough to read these words does wonders for my low self-esteem.

None of these posts gets the full attention and resources each subject deserves. Typically, 60 hours of my week is spent commuting to and managing a chemistry lab.  Most of the rest of my free time is devoured by my offspring and is spent shooting rats down at the city dump.  Plus, I&#8217;m really lazy.

All of these things factors conspire to prevent me from fully examining all the issues

I don’t care about libertarian ideology or whatever. The only ideology I subscribe to is utilitarian. I think that voters basing their political decisions based on statistics instead of emotion will facilitate the minimization of suffering in the world. If my views are sometimes aligned with that of libertarian dogma, it’s because history suggests that concentration of power in the hands of a few is more likely to lead to war, oppression, and suffering generally.
