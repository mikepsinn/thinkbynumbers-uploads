  Sex is one of the great human pastimes. In fact, everywhere you look, there seems to be something or other hinting at sex. Whether it’s the sensual glances beckoning from the magazine rack in the front of the grocery store or the major FUPA issue affecting the lady at the checkout counter (who is, of course, buying condoms), sex is a pervading influence in our pants. Lives. I mean lives.
</p>

&nbsp;

It seems natural, therefore, that almost everyone has an opinion when it comes to reproductive services. Lots of people who want to have sex don’t want to have children right away, and NO ONE who has sex (I hope) wants STDS. This is where [Planned Parenthood](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/) comes in. Planned Parenthood has been providing people with the means to safe and affordable nookie since [1916](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/history-and-successes.htm#Sanger).

&nbsp;

If you read the news, you probably know that Planned Parenthood is not best known for providing safe and affordable nookie. It is best known for providing abortions, which have always been and still are very, very controversial. Because of this, various pro-life initiatives have been whittling away at Planned Parenthood’s federal funding for years in the hopes that it would stop abortions from taking place.

&nbsp;

Now, in 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has [promised](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/mitt-romney-clarifies-abortion-stance-re-affirms-desire-to-defund-planned-parenthood/) to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood, citing moral opposition to abortion. He told reporters that he wants to go a step further and [repeal Roe vs. Wade](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/opinion/if-roe-v-wade-goes.html), the1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion in the United States. Cutting Planned Parenthood’s funds won’t just stop abortions, it will help Romney reach his goal of capping federal spending at [**20% of the GDP**](http://thinkbynumbers.org/?p=2501).

&nbsp;

It turns out that this is nothing new for Planned Parenthood, which has braved constant attacks since its inception.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<p align="center">
  <strong>A Very Brief History</strong>
</p>

&nbsp;

The trouble started right from the beginning. The organization’s founder, [Margaret Sanger,](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/timeline/index.html) was an integral part of getting birth control legalized in 1938. When she founded Planned Parenthood, it was a birth control clinic; it was shut down in [10 days](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger) and Sanger was jailed, not for the first time (she had just gone to trial for using the term [_birth control_](http://www.archives.gov/nyc/education/sanger.html) in print. Scandalous). Sanger was actually partially behind the invention of The Pill itself, having convinced [Gregory Pincus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Goodwin_Pincus), one if its inventors, to try to create it.

&nbsp;

As time progressed, Planned Parenthood grew in size and scope, adding STD testing, cancer screening, and other services to its menu. It started receiving federal funding under [President Nixon](https://public.health.oregon.gov/HealthyPeopleFamilies/ReproductiveSexualHealth/Documents/edmat/1_TitleXCelebrationPresentation.pdf) in 1970 in order to expand the services available for [women of little financial means](http://www.npr.org/2011/03/22/134662664/abortion-foes-target-family-planning-program). Today, Planned Parenthood has [820 clinics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood) in the United States and is one of the largest providers of women’s health and reproductive services in the nation.

&nbsp;

  <strong>So How Many Abortions (and other services) Does Planned Parenthood Perform?</strong>
</p>

&nbsp;

Planned parenthood provides a variety of [reproductive services](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/) to both sexes (who knew?).  Sexually Transmitted Disease and Infection testing made up [38%](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) of Planned Parenthood’s services, while contraception makes up another [33.5%](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage). That&#8217;s [4,179,053](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) and [3,685,437](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) people treated in 2010, respectively. The third most provided service is cancer screenings and prevention, with a [14.5%](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) slice of the pie. In contrast, abortion services account for [3%](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) of all services provided.

&nbsp;

In 2010, Planned Parenthood treated just over [11 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) people. The breakdown can be found in the chart below.

&nbsp;

Many pro-life advocates are concerned about which trimester abortions take place in, since third-trimester fetuses are much more similar to infants. Planned Parenthood does not specify which trimesters its abortions are performed during. However, data suggests that only [1.3%](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/PPFA/fact_abafterfirsttrimester_2011-04.pdf) of abortions occur after 21 weeks (2<sup>nd</sup> trimester) of gestation.

  <strong>Money</strong>
</p>

&nbsp;

In 2010, Planned Parenthood received [$487.4 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) from the U.S. government. With a total 2010 revenue of [$1.0482 billion](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage), the federal contributions constituted about [46.5%](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) of Planned Parenthood’s funding. The rest of the money came from non-government health services revenue ([$320.1 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage)), donations ([$223.8 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage)), and other operating revenue ([$16.9 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage)).

&nbsp;

That same year, Planned Parenthood sustained expenses of [$1.0297 billion](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage). Planned Parenthood spent a nearly [68%](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) of its revenue on medical services in 2010. The two biggest expenses were medical services ([$699.2 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage)) and management and general ([$121.3 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage)). Other top expenses included public policy ([$56.2 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage)), fundraising ([$48 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage)), and sexuality education and affiliate services ([$42 million](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) apiece).

  <strong>Bye-Bye, Funds</strong>
</p>

&nbsp;

Planned Parenthood has been offering abortions since they became legal, just three years after President Nixon signed the [Title X Family Planning Program](http://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/) as an amendment to the Public Health Service Act. Federal funding, it should be noted, [cannot be allocated to abortions](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/48651.html) by law. However, pro-life advocates say that providing federal funding to Planned Parenthood allows the organization to use its own money to fund abortions. As a result of all of this, Planned Parenthood funding has been cut in [several states](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/09/06/807061/defunding-planned-parenthood-caused-womens-servicesto-drop-by-93-percent-in-tennessee-county/) and still others are making moves to follow suit.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, when Planned Parenthood funding is cut, the [97%](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/ppfa_financials_2010_122711_web_vf?mode=window&viewMode=doublePage) of Planned Parenthood services that are not abortions are also cut. This can make it difficult for women, especially the financially needy, to get cancer screenings, STD testing, and other safe-and-affordable-nookie-related services.  The cuts may also have other, [less intuitive](http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/116/2/379.abstract) results as well.

&nbsp;

So what have we learned? Everyone likes sex; Planned Parenthood helps people ‘do the nasty’ in an informed and safe way; abortion is a touchy subject and it may cost Planned Parenthood the funds it needs to perform its other services. Whether Planned Parenthood will be allowed to keep federal funding, and to what extent, remains to be seen. In the meantime, you stay classy, San Diego.
