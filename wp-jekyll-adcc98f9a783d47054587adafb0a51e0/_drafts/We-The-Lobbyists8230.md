  To many, ‘lobbying’ is an ugly word. And considering that lobbyists are busy bees in Washington, especially during election time, this is an understandable sentiment. But what are these lobbyists actually doing, and who do they support? Let’s find out.
</p>

_The Skinny on Lobbyists_

Let’s quickly review what a lobbyist is before launching into the numbers. According to the ever-omniscient [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying), lobbying simply involves trying to influence laws to help a certain cause. The term is broad, blanketing everything from paid corporate lobbyists to grassroots advocacy.

According to [opensecrets.org](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/index.php), which boasts an impressive aresenal of lobbying stats, [$3.33 billion](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/index.php) was spent on lobbying in 2011. A list of the [top spending lobbying groups](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=s) can be found on the site as well. See the chart below for the lowdown on the top five for 2011. Other heavy hitters include AARP, Exxon Mobil, Verizon, and Boeing. These companies are hiring out of a pool of over [12,000](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/index.php) political lobbyists, whose [tactics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States#Lobbying_methods_and_techniques) range from networking to cornering legislators as they walk to Starbucks to the occasional illegal gift. These lobbyists push for laws that make things easier for the corporations they work for, which, as seen in the chart, can include tax breaks, government contracts, and relaxed regulations.

_Campaign Contribution Laws_

The U.S. has strict [regulations](http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/fecfeca.shtml) when it comes to how much certain parties can contribute to political campaigns, largely in order to stop organizations (and therefore lobbyists) from trying to bribe candidates. These stipulate that corporations and labor organizations are not allowed to make any contributions at all. Corporations, however, can form Political Action Committees, which can give up to [$5000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States).

In order to get around campaign contribution laws, corporations and other organizations hire lobbyists to bundle funds from various individuals, committees, and other donors into larger gifts to the campaign. So, while corporations are not allowed to make large contributions themselves, they are allowed to give large amounts to lobbyists who can do the job for them.

&nbsp;

_Campaign Contributions_

Here is some lobbyist and corporate data for both of the presidential candidates. Obama has famously [refused](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/04/barack-obama/barack-obamas-campaign-says-they-dont-accept-lobby/) to accept contributions from lobbyists, although some say that the definition of a ‘federally registered lobbyist’ gives him some [wiggle room](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/us/politics/obama-bundlers-have-ties-to-lobbying.html?pagewanted=all). His actions, however, have definitely made Romney the lobbyist candidate of choice.

The commercial contributions are NOT bundled contributions and are instead donations from employees and family members of the companies, as well as the companies’ PACs. They could be reflective of natural political bias of certain companies or efforts by the company to fundraise for candidates who are more friendly to their businesses (most likely both). Members of certain industries tend to favor specific candidates because of policy, but more of the big lobbying companies support Romney, as you can see.

_What Does This Mean?_

&nbsp;

So what does political lobbying do? Sometimes candidates can’t change their opinions too much lest they lose support (example: Mitt Romney and the [National Rifle Association](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hFDBkJeJ4wfXTXQ3AMvpucMqLysQ?docId=CNG.a514f4de519d6873aa2a708f67df099b.351)), and lobbyists can raise quite a bit of money, providing more advertising power for the candidates they back. But in the end, lobbying can only go so far to ensure that someone is elected. The American people are the ones who vote, after all, and we can choose to look at the numbers instead of the glossy, lobbyist-funded advertising. So let’s hear it for smart thinking: don’t cheat on your taxes, exercise 3-4 times a week, and serve yourself up a steaming pile of cold, hard, lobbyist-free facts before you head to the polls.
