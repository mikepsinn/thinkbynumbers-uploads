      Many political groups in the U.S. have ten-point programs or platforms: libertarians, communitarians, &#8220;progressives,&#8221; &#8220;Christians,&#8221; and so on. Often I like some of the proposals of these groups and dislike others &#8211; or, more often, just think that they&#8217;ve missed the important things. I&#8217;ve decided to put together my own platform. The question I ask is: what if there were a Utilitarian Party? What would its platform be? Here is a first attempt.
