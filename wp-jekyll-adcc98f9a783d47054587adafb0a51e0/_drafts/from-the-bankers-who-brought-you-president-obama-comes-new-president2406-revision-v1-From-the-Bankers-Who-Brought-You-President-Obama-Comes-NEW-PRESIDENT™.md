## 2013 Budget Plans

#### New Look! Same Great Waste!

Obama&#8217;s 2013 budget is [$3.80 Trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget). Romney&#8217;s will be $3.79 trillion.

Budget Changes Specified by Candidate Romney™:

  1. Eliminate Obamacare (which is ironically very similar to Romneycare aside from the fact that Romneycare also covered abortions) &#8211; Estimated Savings = [$122](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/07/27/cbo-obamacare-will-spend-more-tax-more-and-reduce-the-deficit-less-than-we-previously-thought/&refURL=http://thinkbynumbers.org&referrer=http://thinkbynumbers.org) billion annually
  2. Increase Military Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = [$45](https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2011%2F11%2F07%2Fworld%2Fpanetta-weighs-military-cuts-once-thought-out-of-bounds.html%3F_r%3D5&REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR) billion annually
  3. Increase Medicare Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = [$71](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/a-campaign-full-of-mediscare/) billion annually
  4. &#8220;Deep Reductions&#8221; in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts &#8211; Estimated Savings = [$0.15](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Arts-Spending-Cut-as-2012/195421) billion annually
  5. Eliminate Amtrak Subsidies &#8211; Estimated Savings = [$1.6](http://reason.com/archives/2011/11/09/absolutely-profligate) billion annually
  6. Eliminate Title X Family Planning Programs &#8211; Estimated Savings = [$0.3](http://khn.org/news/planned-parenthood-title-10/) billion annually

Add it up.  Romney&#8217;s Total Savings = $0.01 trillion less than Obama&#8217;s budget! With a national debt on the order of [$16.2](http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current) trillion, you’ll barely even notice the difference!

## Past Spending Records

##### Are you tired of all that money cluttering up your home?  Try NEW PRESIDENT™!

Governor Romney™ has been scientifically proven to increase spending faster than the President Obama™! Obama has only increased government spending a disappointing [5.5%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-facts-about-the-growth-of-spending-under-obama/2012/05/24/gJQAIJh6nU_blog.html) annually over his term.

Under Governor Romney, Massachusetts state spending went from $22.3 billion to $28.1 billion,  an amazing [6.5%](https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fthecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2007%2F12%2F31%2Fclarification-on-huckabee-and-romney-spending%2F%3F_r%3D5&REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR) per year! That’s faster than most other leading governors (6.2%)! And if we&#8217;ve learned anything from the vast disparity between George W. Bush’s fiscal rhetoric and [fiscal record](https://www.mercatus.org/publication/spending-under-president-george-w-bush), it’s that Romney’s gubernatorial record might be a better indicator of what we could expect from a Romney federal budget.
