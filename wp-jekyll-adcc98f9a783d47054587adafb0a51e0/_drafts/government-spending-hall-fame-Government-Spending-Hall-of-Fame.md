Many did not know about the almost two hundred dead in the process of its making and the challenges that the US Government faced in making this marvel a reality.

With almost $800 million in total cost (<a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=2" target="_blank">$782 million to be exact</a>), Hoover Dam practically slouched off $6.354 on each US citizen taxpayers’ money in the year <a title="US population from 1900" href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm" target="_blank">1930</a>.

In the end, the action reaped a $14 billion loss of tax payers’ money and two new companies (the new GM and new Chrysler) that according to <a title="National Affairs" href="http://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-auto-bailout-and-the-rule-of-law" target="_blank">Todd Zywicki</a>, a George Mason University Foundation Professor, “would have emerged stronger and more competitive had they pursued normal bankruptcies, not massive bailouts followed by bankruptcies run by the government.”

**<a title="Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)" href="http://troubled-asset-relief-program.net/" target="_blank">TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program)</a>** – The Troubled Asset Relief Program or better known as TARP is a program built to give financial assistance to financial institutions that are under the water or are barely keeping afloat, according to <a title="What is TARP" href="http://bingaman.senate.gov/policy/issues/20090202-01.cfm" target="_blank">U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman’s website</a>. It was created in October <a title="U.S. Population by State, 1700-2010" href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004986.html" target="_blank">2008</a> during the financial crisis as solution in promoting stability in financial markets. The program was passed and named the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act 2008, H.R. 3997. The U.S. Treasury was entitled to spend $700 billion to stabilize the economy as authorized by Congress.

Since its inception, it has been supporting the American International Group and gave aid to the automotive industry and grant programs aimed at avoiding home foreclosures. The most recent CBO report on money spent for the TARP is <a title="Surprise! The Big Bad Bailout is paying off" href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/07/08/surprise-the-big-bad-bailout-is-paying-off/" target="_blank">$19 billion</a> which would reap a per capita rate of $62.99 per tax-paying U.S. citizen.

&nbsp;

**<a title="The History Guy" href="http://www.historyguy.com/GulfWar.html#.T1CVO9lZfMx" target="_blank">GULF WAR I </a>**– The war that started on the Iraqis invasion of Kuwait through bombing Kuwait City, Kuwait’s Capital. The conflict of this war was due to Iraq’s claim of Kuwait as one of its territories, their great debt to Kuwait, and their accusation of Kuwait exceeding its OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) quotas in turn controlling the price of oil—the life blood of Iraqi economy. Due to this invasion, the United Nations made Resolution 661 which authorized a naval blockade to enforce an embargo against Iraq. Thirteen nations including the United States voted for the resolution to be imposed upon Iraq. This is the first major war which involved Uncle Sam since the Vietnam wars.

In the end, the Iraqi initiated war ended with a peace conference where a ceasefire agreement was negotiated and signed by both parties. Estimated civilian fatalities incurred in these hostilities were about 103,500 while Iraqi military fatalities were estimated at about 25,000. The coalition forces, which include the U.S., incurred fewer fatalities with only a total of 464 military personnel. With a total cost of <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=4" target="_blank">$98 billion</a>, the per capita rate of each tax-paying U.S. citizen in <a title="US population from 1900" href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm" target="_blank">1990</a> amounts to $392.88. A hefty price to pay in aiding allied countries not to mention the emotional and physical pains some people experienced being in the scene of the crossfire.

**<a title="The Marshall Plan" href="http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/Ritschl.Marshall.Plan" target="_blank">MARSHALL PLAN </a>**– This refers to Uncle Sam’s move of giving financial aid to help rebuild European countries’ economies after the end of World War II which includes <a title="The Wasting of Britain's Marshall Aid" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/marshall_01.shtml" target="_blank">Great Britain</a>, France, Italy, West Germany, and the Netherlands. The Marshall plan’s official name is the European Recovery Program (ERP). The program was in effect for four years giving fuel, raw materials, goods, loans, food, machinery and advisers to funded countries which impacted a major effect in European economic growth.

Named after one of its initiators General George Marshall, the Marshall Plan was the initiative suggested to prevent the spread of communism all over Europe, Stalin’s goal for Europe. The Marshall Plan cost Uncle Sam a total of <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=5" target="_blank">$115.30 billion</a>. The per capita rate per tax-paying U.S. citizen in the year <a title="US population from 1900" href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm" target="_blank">1948</a> was $786.33.

&nbsp;

**<a title="Lousiana Purchase" href="http://geography.about.com/od/historyofgeography/a/louisianapurcha.htm" target="_blank">LOUISIANA PURCHASE</a>** – This is the event of purchasing the 2 million square kilometers of land that comprises the present states of Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wyoming. The treaty that declares Uncle Sam’s ownership of the land seeded to the French was signed on April 30, 1830. Though the former intention was to buy just a track of land in the port locale of New Orleans, the French instead served a whole territory of land to a silver platter as they find it difficult to maintain control of lands far from France at the same time they need to raise funds for their plans of conquering England.

The price of 60 million francs was to be paid directly to France with the balance to be covered from French debt to American citizens. The Louisiana Purchase was one of the great successes of Jefferson’s administration as the <a title="U.S. Population, 1790-2000: Always Growing" href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h980.html" target="_blank">1830s</a> was the start of growing American population. A total amount of <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=6" target="_blank">$217 billion</a> was the payment for this big chunk of land and the per capita rate of each U.S. tax-paying citizen at that time was $16,873.

<a title="First Man on the Moon" href="http://history1900s.about.com/od/1960s/p/firstmanmoon.htm" target="_blank"><strong>RACE TO THE MOON</strong> </a>– As part of the race to space explorations, the moon landing was one of the historical successes that proved Uncle Sam’s seat in this arena together with the Soviet Union. In July 16, 1969 the Apollo 11 was launched from the Kennedy space Center in Florida. Here, Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Micheal Collins started the three-day journey to the Moon also called the translunar coast.

After entering the Moon’s orbit and orbiting it for a full day in July 19, Armstrong and Aldrin boarded the lunar module to begin their descent to the Moon’s surface. Collin’s on the other hand stayed to check for visual problems on their way at the same time became the first man to successfully orbit the moon. In July 20, Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon together with Aldrin. They explored and take samples from it before returning to their ship to start their trip back to Earth. This endeavor became a milestone in American space exploration history for a total cost of <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=7" target="_blank">$237 billion</a>. Each tax-paying U.S. citizen’s per capita rate is $1,355 in the year <a title="US population from 1900" href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm" target="_blank">1958</a> when the project started, a worth it price for a notable achievement of mankind. As in Armstrong’s words, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”

    Savings and Loans Crisis

</div>

&nbsp;

<a title="Savings and Loans Crisis" href="http://econlib.org/library/Enc/SavingsandLoanCrisis.html" target="_blank"><strong>SAVINGS & LOANS CRISIS</strong></a> – The crisis which conceived one of the most costly and extensive government bailouts of all time, the Savings and Loans Crisis was said to be a disaster waiting to happen because of the many ill-advised S&L investments made and the lax government regulatory restrains on its lending policies. The institutions involved in this crisis were Savings and Loans Associations which are financial institutions that were created to accept savings from private investors and provide home mortgage services for the public. These S&Ls grew in number and later became unmanageable, losing more money from loans rather than gaining money from deposits. Also, the many interventions devised by government to better its situation never killed the root of the problem but rather worsened it in the process.

As Congress put down the barriers separating commercial banks from S&Ls in 1989, many S&Ls were either outright merged or acquired by bank holding companies moonlighting into the broader banking industry. By the end of 2004 only 886 S&Ls remained which are usually owned by bank holding companies. The cost of the S&L Crisis is <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=8" target="_blank">$256 billion</a>. The per capita rate per paying U.S citizen is $1,066 in the year <a title="US Population From 1900" href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm" target="_blank">1986</a>.

With poor military defenses, Seoul suffered in the hands of North Korea in a week making them easily advance further south. The United Nations where Uncle Sam is also a member responded through sending military aid on air, water, and ground. The United Nations Security Council members unanimously condemned North Korea’s action in invading South Korea which resulted to their support. On the other hand, The People’s Republic of China sided with North Korea and attacked coalition forces upon their entry to North Korean territory.

The war lasted for three years and ended with an armistice agreement. It is also by this time when the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) was established which is still standing now patrolled by Korean People’s Army and Republic of Korea Army, US, and Joint UN Commands. The cost that Uncle Sam put to use in this war of territories was <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=9" target="_blank">$454 billion</a> which would have a per capita rate of $2,981.52 to each tax-paying citizen.

Uncle Sam declared war against the terrorists responsible in the attack on that day which was identified as the organization called al-Queda that made Afghanistan their base. The declaration of war was initiated in the Bush administration and is now carefully put into an end by the Obama administration this summer. The goal for this mission, Operation Enduring Freedom, was to find all al-Queda high-ranking members and its founder Osama bin Laden and put them on trial to finally destroy the al-Queda and remove the Taliban regime in Afghanistan that protects the said organization. Mission development was bin Laden’s death last May 2, 2011 which was initiated by U.S. Navy Seals and CIA operatives in a covert operation in a residential compound in Pakistan.

    The New Deal

</div>

<a title="The New deal basic and history" href="http://livingnewdeal.berkeley.edu/resources/new-deal-basics/" target="_blank"><strong>THE NEW DEAL</strong></a> – This is the remedy that Roosevelt brewed for the Great Depression. Many suffered on the low economic health of the country. Unemployment rate was high and there was financial instability. The New Deal was said to carve a route of the “3Rs” which stands for Relief for the unemployed and poor; Recovery of the economy to normal levels; and Reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression. With the New Deal, many economic programs were implemented which gave the people jobs, stabilized prices for industry that stabilized banks, uplifted human morale as it improved the lives of people, and built hundreds of thousands of infrastructures that are still used until today.

However, despite the success the New Deal reaped there are some that questioned its actions. They complained of enlarging the powers of the federal government, rescuing capitalism, slowed long-term economic growth, and weakening businesses. Whether it was a good or bad investment, the <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=10" target="_blank">$500 billion</a> spent for it is big money that can either way be interpreted differently depending which side you are on. The per capita rate per U.S. tax-paying citizen in year <a title="US Population From 1900" href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm" target="_blank">1933 </a>was $3,982.

This resulted to full force attack to Al-Queda terrorists and other known terrorists. This is one of the actions that Uncle Sam took that received many <a title="War on Terror" href="http://www.globalissues.org/issue/245/war-on-terror" target="_blank">criticisms</a> from human rights activists and the media as there are many concerns regarding the broad objectives of the action made which is believed to be prone for human rights abuses in the process.

As it is still an on-going action, the result of this war is still uncertain but the death toll is still rising on both parties especially on civilian casualties caught in the crossfire. The inflation adjusted cost for this anti-terrorism venture is <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=11" target="_blank">$597 billion</a>.

<a title="Vietnam War" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" target="_blank"><strong>VIETNAM WAR</strong></a> – It is a cold war era, military conflicts happened in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The Vietnam War is the precursor of the unification of Vietnam. Before, North Vietnam together with the support of other communist nations waged war with South Vietnam which was allied by the United Nations Coalition group which includes the United States. Uncle Sam seized this war to contain the spread of communism while North Vietnam saw it as a colonial war against France, its colonizer, and later the US together with South Vietnam.

In August 15, 1973, US military involvement ended because of the passing of the Case-Church Amendment which was made to cut military support to Vietnam. The Vietnam War ended in the capture of the capital city of South Vietnam, Saigon in April 1975. The reunification of North and South Vietnam started thereafter leaving millions of war casualties from both sides together with civilians. The cost billed for this sumptuous war is <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=12" target="_blank">$698 billion</a> and the per capita rate of $3,637.52 for every U.S. tax-paying citizen of <a title="US Population From 1900" href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm" target="_blank">1964</a>&#8211;the start of Uncle Sam&#8217;s support to South Vietnam.

<a title="A Brief History of NASA" href="http://history.nasa.gov/factsheet.htm" target="_blank"><strong>50-YEAR NASA CUMULATIVE SPENDING</strong></a> – When Congress and the President of the United States conceived the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in <a title="US Population From 1900" href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm" target="_blank">1958</a>, it is in light of the pressures of national defense during the Cold War era. In this era, space exploration became one of the major areas of contest between Uncle Sam and the Great Bear. Within this 50-year NASA spending, many space milestones were realized including the popular moon landing of Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin. Satellites were launched and many space discoveries were learned. Thanks to their simple preamble such feats became a reality, _&#8220;An Act to provide for research into the problems of flight within and outside the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, and for other purposes.&#8221;   _

We have seen many successes through NASA since its inception and much imagination is becoming a reality when it comes to space exploration so maybe <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=13" target="_blank">$851.20 billion</a> was a value worthy spent? Each U.S. tax-paying citizen can be proud to own $4,867.28 each for it. Without you such marvels will be left for the imagination still.

The 70’s was the year of Hippie culture which surged the number of drug users into all high levels that placed pressure to government accountability. Until now, drugs have not dissolved from government’s list of priorities which brings many to think whether the past 40 years of intervention to as much prevent its spread and curtail it were effective. This in turn made the present administration adjust its spectacles and focused on prevention and rehabilitation instead of to the criminal justice system in apprehending drug traffickers as said by <a title="Alternatives to the War on Drugs" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/21/alternatives-war-drugs-obama-drug-policy-and-reforming-criminal-justice-system" target="_blank">President Barrack Obama in one of his speeches</a>. But as budget implementation played, higher budget was allocated to the war on drugs yet higher funding is still given to the criminal justice system than on drug prevention and treatment contrary to what was said in Obama&#8217;s speech.

One cannot see the end point of this pursuit but for now the total spending in this relentless war already reached <a title="US War On Drugs Has Met None Of Its Goals: AP Impact" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/13/us-war-on-drugs-has-met-n_n_575351.html" target="_blank">$1 trillion </a>which takes $4,815.55 straight from U.S. tax-paying citizen’s pockets.

<a title="Iraq War" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War" target="_blank"><strong>IRAQ WAR</strong></a> – An eight year war that was recently concluded last December 18, 2011, it was initiated by Uncle Sam together with John Bull due to Iraq’s alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). As enumerated in Resolution 1441, Iraq’s violation to national security also includes their known construction of prohibited types of missiles, purchase and import of prohibited armaments, and refusal to compensate Kuwait for their widespread looting during the 1990-1991 Kuwait invasion and occupation. A US-lead Iraq Survey Group was sent to check on Iraq and their activities. They reported that Iraq had ended its nuclear, chemical, and biological programs since 1991. This war led to the occupation of Iraq and later capture of former Iraq President Saddam Hussein who was tried in an Iraqi court of law and later executed by the new Iraqi government.

The total cost of Uncle Sam’s strong conviction against Iraq regarding their allegations despite the negative reports of the three US-led Survey Groups was <a title="Iraq war in figures" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11107739" target="_blank">$3 trillion</a> which amounts to $10,316.76 per capita rate, the amount that equals to the contribution of every U.S. tax-paying citizen of <a title="United States and Texas Populations 1850-2010" href="https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/census.html" target="_blank">2003</a>.

This economic stimulus package was created to respond to the Long Recession in late year 2000. The Stimulus Spending Bill was based from Keynesian macroeconomic theory which was the economic model used in the later part of the Great Depression. Its objective was to readily save and create jobs, provide temporary relief programs to areas affected by the recession, and invest in green energy, education, health, and infrastructure. Through the law, direct spending was made in the expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions. But some <a title="Cost of Senate's stimulus plan hits $888B" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-01-29-stimulus_N.htm" target="_blank">critics</a> to this government action site some direct spending done under this law that are not economic recovery related as the study of the effectiveness of medical treatments, a long-term spending project specifically included by Congress.

So what is really the real score with this Stimulus Spending Bill? It already cost Uncle Sam a total of <a title="True Cost of Stimulus: $3.27 Trillion" href="http://blog.heritage.org/2009/02/12/true-cost-of-stimulus-327-trillion/" target="_blank">$3.270 trillion </a>of tax-payers money or $10,651.24 per capita rate, pretty big cost for anybody to just shrug their shoulders with.

    World War II
  </p>
</div>

<a title="World War Two" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/" target="_blank"><strong>WORLD WAR II</strong></a> – The most devastating war that was started because of the intentions of declaring one’s supreme race, World War II was incited by Germany’s Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler in <a title="US Population From 1900" href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm" target="_blank">1941</a>. His obsession of the idea of German superiority from all races led to bloodshed of millions of both Jews and non-Jews in Germany. The war started in the invasion of Poland where France and Britain declared war to Germany. Uncle Sam on the other hand became part of this global assault that Hitler planned through the attacks Japan threw in the Pacific, an ally of Germany. As wars were conceived in almost every part of the globe, many alliances were made and broken that later led to the death of Hitler and his obsessive desire for superiority. The death toll reached 60 million with many more wounded victims psychologically, emotionally, and physically.

For such an extravagant endeavor to prove ones worth to the world, by far this is the most costly act men made. Hitler’s obsession cost Uncle Sam <a title="Big Budget Events" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/27717424/?slide=14" target="_blank">$3.6 trillion</a>. This includes aid to Britain when World War II started between Britain and France against Germany. The per capita of such amount was $26,986 from every U.S. tax-paying citizen.

That&#8217;s all our U.S. Government Spending Hall of Fame. Now, let&#8217;s look closer on all 19 figures incurred in each event honorees through a graph depicted below:

<dl id="attachment_1867" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 574px;">

</dl>

One could easily notice the many war spending done our government invested through the years. Some of which were even made for an indirect benefit for our country like the Korean and Vietnam wars. Both were known to be supported by Uncle Sam to curtail the growth of communism from the North, the Great Bear as its rival to this global objective. Also, part of our Hall of Fame honorees are some of the other government actions done to rival this objective. These were the Marshall Plan and the creation of NASA (to also fight in the race of space exploration). On the other hand, the benefits of war is economic growth which declares to the world how powerful and rich Uncle Sam is.

The wars of years ago such as the World War II was seen by many economists to be beneficial as it carried the country through the Great Depression despite its cost (the top of the list of honorees). Meanwhile, the latest wars like the Iraq and Afghanistan wars tend to shake our economy. This is because much of these wars expenditures were made through debt. Add to that the action of cutting taxes of the Bush administration. All these factors placed the economy dead smack on the floor in a limbo dance for life.

This in turn produced many costly interventions. One is the stimulus spending bill which ranks second in our Government Spending Hall of Fame. An added attack to the already injured economy is the recent Long recession, here the Auto bailout and the TARP joined in to help the economy and its constituents afloat. All interventions warrant mention in the honorees table of the Government Spending Hall of Fame as these should have been prevented if reasonable actions were made against a vague war having unproven worth like the War on Terror and the Iraq War.

Also a result of under planned action is the Savings and Loans Crisis which was ironically expected by many analysts to fail since its inception. Clearly, a waste of energy. Unlike the Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal that despite the many criticisms it encountered public morale and hope was raised from the depths of the Great Depression.

Another war that has been present for a long time killing and putting many young people in correctional facilities as we speak is the war on drugs. Though huge chunks of budget is given to it every year, it seemed to have not amounted to any visible positive outcome. There is really a need for another closer look. But not merely in words but rather in action.

But despite these unchecked undertakings in our honorees line-up, placed alongside them are marvels that many would agree as a valuable legacy spent by the masses like the first Moon landing, the building of the Hoover Dam and the Panama Canal, and the Louisiana Purchase.

Each honoree in the Government Spending Hall of Fame entailed great spending from our hard earned paychecks. Let us try to evaluate the pattern of spending our government has been doing for the past years and maybe, just maybe we can find ways to do our part in changing the tide. As what was said earlier, again I say much change entails great cost.

I leave you to see for yourself and decide whether you are for or against the conclusions made. The comments section is awaiting for a healthy discussion.
