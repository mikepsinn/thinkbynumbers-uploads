</p>

Congratulations! You have been accepted into an elite group of people eligible to write for Think by Numbers (also known as anyone who has ever visited this site). When making submissions, please keep the following points in mind to ensure that we can publish your brilliant masterpiece.

**1. Think by Numbers**

This means the more numerical evidence you can find for something, the better. Do the math. Make graphs. Come up with real proof of your point, take a picture of it in its underwear, and put it up on the Internet.

**2. Don’t Be Biased**

Sometimes it can be very hard not to let your own beliefs shine through in an article, especially anyone who doesn’t agree with you is clearly a hedonistic scoundrel. Don’t do it, though. I find a useful technique is to pretend I&#8217;m writing a letter to persuade my conservative paternal grandfather (who I love very much). You have to convince the reader that you agree with them from the beginning and you are on their side.  It&#8217;s like using a literary Trojan horse to get the facts inside their brains. When they see the numbers, hopefully they will give it some thought without you pointing out the obvious.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**3. Don’t Plagiarize**

&nbsp;

We know that you would never, ever copy and paste something off the web and submit it to us. Of course not. You know better. You are an educated and sophisticated person with a conscience. And you know that if you do it, the TBN bouncer, George, knows where you live (not really, but you get the point).

&nbsp;

There is no good guide to how to cite in Internet articles, so we are taking a few precautions:

&nbsp;

  * Whenever you have a fact, figure, or something you gleaned from anywhere other than your brain, hyperlink it.
  * When quoting, use quotation marks and indicate who said it. Example: “c is for cookies,” said Cookie Monster.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**4. Find Good Sources**

&nbsp;

Even if you provide a hyperlink to a source, nobody is going to be impressed if they click on it and find Perezhilton.com. Your sources should be as reliable and unbiased as possible. Good bets are sites like Wikipedia, FactCheck.org, and government sites. News outlets – preferably unbiased ones – are also good.
