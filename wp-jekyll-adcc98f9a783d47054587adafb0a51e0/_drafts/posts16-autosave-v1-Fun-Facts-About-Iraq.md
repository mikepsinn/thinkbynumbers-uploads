  1. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">At least <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/world/middleeast/23casualties.html?_r=4" target="_blank">100,000 civilians</a> have been killed. That&#8217;s the equivalent of 35 September 11th attacks, but I don&#8217;t like to brag.</span>
  2. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">Another interesting factoid is that the war will end up costing at least <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090302200.html" target="_blank">$3 trillion</a>.  With that much money, you could <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/opinion/ed-food23" target="_blank">end world hunger </a>for 100 years or end American hunger for 100 minutes!</span>
  3. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;">Over <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-06-05-iraq-report_N.htm">4 million Iraqis</a> have lost their homes a result of the war.  That&#8217;s equivalent to the population of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population">Maine, Idaho, and New Hampshire </a>combined. Sorry, guys. You cannot all crash on my couch.</span>
