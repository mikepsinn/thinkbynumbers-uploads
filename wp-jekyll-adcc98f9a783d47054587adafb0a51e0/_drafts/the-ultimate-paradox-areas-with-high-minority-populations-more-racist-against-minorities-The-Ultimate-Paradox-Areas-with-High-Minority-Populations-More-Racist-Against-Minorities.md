When I first started researching this topic, I couldn’t help but feel a little bit baffled by my findings. After all, you would think that in the areas with the heaviest population of any ethnicity, that ethnicity would have the most power. Therefore, in places with more African Americans, it would make sense that more laws would lean towards their interests. We, the people, right?  
Wrong. So, so wrong.

**What the History Books Say**

&nbsp;

In some areas in the United States, the problem of segregation – specifically, the problem of Jim Crow laws forbidding real equality between whites and blacks – were either a non-issue or might have phased out on their own. Unfortunately, the areas where such laws likely would not have gone away without government intervention are also the areas in which they hurt African Americans the most.

&nbsp;

Take, for instance, school segregation. As soon as Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in [1863](http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bhmtimeline.html), certain states took immediate measures to keep the races separate. One of the most obvious ways to do this was making it illegal for blacks and whites to go to school together. Although school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the Brown vs. Board ruling of [1954](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0347_0483_ZS.html), many states frowned upon or even outlawed segregation in public schools before the national ruling. Take a look at the map below:

Scroll back up to the map at the beginning of this article, then come back down to this one. Yes, it’s true that the South tried to form a separate country, was steeped in a history of slavery, and therefore was more prone to segregation. But Brown vs. Board occurred in 1954, and literally [thousands](http://www.history.com/topics/african-american-leaders-during-reconstruction) of African Americans had been involved in politics since they were freed from slavery. The fact that they were kept in separate schools for as long as they were, despite representation and strength in numbers, is unsavory at best.

&nbsp;

Here’s another example: interracial marriage. Although it was officially overturned in [1967](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) by the aptly named Loving v. Virginia case, interracial marriage had already been legalized in well over half of U.S. States by that time. Check out the map below. Looks familiar, right?

If the question is whether we really needed all that legislation to get rid of segregation, the answer is – it depends on where you live. If you are from the South, it was probably necessary. If not, perhaps it was not needed. But that begs the question:

**Is Segregation Really Gone?**

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/11/nyregion/segregation-in-new-york-city-public-schools.html" rel="attachment wp-att-3033"><img title="Amurca4" src="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Amurca4-e1353110542357.png?resize=600%2C604" alt="" width="600" height="604" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

No. As long as racial lines exist in neighborhoods and income classes, segregation will likely persist. The trend, in education at least, is simple: economically affluent persons, who are [usually white](http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/21/news/economy/wealth-gap-race/index.htm), can afford to pay for private schools or move into nice neighborhoods with good public schools, while minorities, particularly [blacks and Hispanics](http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/21/news/economy/wealth-gap-race/index.htm), are forced to deal with bad schools.  This is a huge issue in California right now, where Latino students typically go to schools where [66%](http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/mlk-national/e-pluribus...separation-deepening-double-segregation-for-more-students) of students are low-income and over [75%](http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/mlk-national/e-pluribus...separation-deepening-double-segregation-for-more-students) of students are minorities. So, while the problem is now enforced via economics rather than laws, it persists.
