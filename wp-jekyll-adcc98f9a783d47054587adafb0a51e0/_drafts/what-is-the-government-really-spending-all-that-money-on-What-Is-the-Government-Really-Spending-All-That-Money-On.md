  It’s always sad to say goodbye to a portion of your paycheck. But we all know that by handing our dues over to Uncle Sam, we are ensuring that we have schools, roads, prisons, and all of the other amenities of living in a country. Right?

&nbsp;

The truth is that the breakdown of how our tax dollars are spent is a little more complicated than that.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Big Expenses**

&nbsp;

<a href="http://thinkbynumbers.org/?attachment_id=2791" rel="attachment wp-att-2791"><img class="size-full wp-image-2791 alignright" title="Spending" src="https://i0.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Spending-e1352488620189.png?resize=350%2C621" alt="" width="350" height="621" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Spending-e1352488620189.png?w=350&ssl=1 350w, https://i0.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Spending-e1352488620189.png?resize=169%2C300&ssl=1 169w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In 2011, [74%](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1258) of the [$3.63](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_United_States_federal_budget) trillion Federal Budget went towards &#8220;defense and international security assistance,&#8221; social security, federally funded health insurance, and aid programs for low-income individuals and families. Another [6%](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1258) went towards debt interest, leaving [20%](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1258) for everything else, including veteran benefits, transportation, education, and research.

&nbsp;

Military, health, and social security all took the biggest pieces of the pie. As far as the military goes, most of the [$780 billion](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1258) budget apparently went into keeping things going – paying salaries and contractors, purchasing supplies, etc.  [$159 billion](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1258) went into military activity in [Afghanistan and Iraq](http://thinkbynumbers.org/terrorism/suicide-terrorism-statistics/).

&nbsp;

Medicare, Medicaid, and other federally funded insurance plans also left quite a dent. In 2011, [$486 billion](http://www.concordcoalition.org/issues/indicators/government-provided-health-care) went to Medicare, while another [$275 billion](http://www.concordcoalition.org/issues/indicators/government-provided-health-care) went to Medicaid. Finally, Social Security siphoned off another [$731 billion](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&id=1258).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Inside the Pie Slices**

&nbsp;

Of course, each of these pie slices isn’t really made up a homogenous mass of color. They contain salaries, contracts, handouts, and the many other costs that come along with making the whole thing run.

&nbsp;

For an example, let’s use Medicare. Out of a [$528 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_fraud) budget, Medicare gave out [$502 billion](http://misunderstoodfinance.blogspot.com/2011/04/small-percentage-of-medicare.html) in benefits. The other $26 billion, presumably, went to administrative and other costs.

&nbsp;

It also turns out that the benefits are not divided equally. Out of the Medicare beneficiary pool, [10%](http://misunderstoodfinance.blogspot.com/2011/04/small-percentage-of-medicare.html) (4.63 million) people apparently used [70%](http://misunderstoodfinance.blogspot.com/2011/04/small-percentage-of-medicare.html) ($351.4 billion) of the Medicare dollars. Why? Medicare does not share that information with the public. Some of it is probably due to illnesses that are difficult and expensive to treat, but it also might just have something to do with the little problem described below.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Leaky Faucets**

&nbsp;

One unfortunate byproduct of government spending is fraud. In 2010, Medicare fraud may have been as high as [$47.9 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_fraud), 9% of the Medicare budget that year. Although the government does attempt to reclaim some of the losses – in 2011, it got back a record [$4.1 billion](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/February/12-ag-213.html) – it hurts to leak tens of billions in taxpayer dollars. Improper payments, also known as mistakes, cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated [$125 billion](http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2011-02-19/news/fl-federal-government-waste-20110219_1_medicare-fraud-federal-agencies-error-rate) annually. And, of course, even when the feds manage to reclaim some of these costs, everyone knows that the costs of going to court sometimes drown out the payoff.

**“Stupid Spending”**

&nbsp;

Although it makes up a comparatively small part of our federal budget, the kind of federal spending people like to complain about is “[stupid spending](http://origin.heritage.org/research/reports/2009/10/50-examples-of-government-waste#_edn3)” – things that really don’t seem to make sense to fund on paper. It makes sense, when you think that the money you contributed to the tax fund may have gone into paying for some of this stuff. Some good examples include:

&nbsp;

  * [$100 million](http://origin.heritage.org/research/reports/2009/10/50-examples-of-government-waste#_edn3): Unused, refundable airline tickets purchased by the Department of Defense
  * [$1.8 million](http://origin.heritage.org/research/reports/2009/10/50-examples-of-government-waste#_edn3): A private golf course in Atlanta
  * [$230](http://origin.heritage.org/research/reports/2009/10/50-examples-of-government-waste#_edn38): A beer-brewing kit for Homeland Security employees.
