&#8220;Obama plans to slash deficit in half&#8221; is the title of this AP story. The attribution of fiscal responsibility to our current president is rather misleading.

Here&#8217;s a graph from a [Wall Street Journal article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123457407865686565) of the annual federal budget deficits over the last 30 years.

<img class="aligncenter" style="width: 406px; height: 304px;" title="Deep Impact: Federal Budget Surplus/Deficit" src="https://i1.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/NA-AV884_WDEFIC_NS_20090213222641.gif?resize=383%2C288" alt="Graph Showing Federal Budget Surplus/Deficit Since 1980 (30 years)" width="383" height="288" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Bush’s worst deficit was less than $500 billion. Obama’s 1<sup>st</sup> might be [$2 trillion](http://www.atr.org/obamas-first-yearbr-trillion-new-proposed-a4416). Then in four years, he says he might decrease it to [$533 billion](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/21/AR2009022100911.html).

That’s still the worst annual deficit in the entire history of the United States. Then that AP story tries to portray him as a fiscal conservative.

Preposterous, indeed!
