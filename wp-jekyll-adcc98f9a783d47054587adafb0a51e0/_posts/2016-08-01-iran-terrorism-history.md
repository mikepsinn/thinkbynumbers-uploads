Many Americans consider Iran to be a psychopathically violent nation that would be willing to commit suicide in order to kill as many Americans as possible.  The statistics behind historical Iranian US relations do not support this view.

           A plurality of Americans believe that Iran is an irrational, suicide-bound regime that would use nuclear-weapons up in this bitch, given the chance. But is this belief supported by an Iranian history of violence?  Is Iran really a bunch of stone-cold killaz or, alternatively, are these bitchez just yanking our nizzos?

      <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">
           If Iran is truly as wicked hardcore as Americans claim, they should have a history with a serious mutha f***in&#8217; body count. However, when you examine Iran&#8217;s history, it becomes painfully obvious that Iran, in fact, has a p***y for ballz. Despite the incendiary rhetoric of its leaders, Iran, when comparing their body count to that of the United States, just be lookin&#8217; like some candy-ass bitchez.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Conversely, a serious examination of American historical interaction with Iran reveals the US actually possesses grenades for balls that will indeed get your mouf blowed up when you suck them.  Let&#8217;s look at the numbers.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

The aircraft, an Airbus A300B2-203 operated by Iran Air, was flying from Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, over Iran&#8217;s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf on its usual flight path when it was destroyed by the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS <em>Vincennes</em> (CG-49), killing all 290 passengers and crew aboard.

              October 23, 1983, Beirut, Lebanon. A truck loaded with a bomb crashed into the lobby of the U.S. Marines headquarters in Beirut, killing <a href="http://avpv.tripod.com/AmericanVictims.html" target="_blank">241 </a>soldiers and wounding 81. Some analysts believe the Islamic Republic of Iran was heavily involved and that a major factor leading it to participate in the attacks on the barracks was America&#8217;s support for <a title="Iraq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq">Iraq</a> in the <a title="Iran-Iraq War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Iraq_War">Iran-Iraq War</a> and its extending of $2.5 billion in trade credit to Iraq while halting the shipments of arms to Iran. However, in 2001, former Secretary of Defense at the time of the bombing, Caspar Weinberger, stated: &#8220;But we still do not have the actual knowledge of who did the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut Airport, and we certainly didn&#8217;t then.&#8221;

                  Under orders from President Eisenhower, the CIA organized a military coup that overthrew Iran&#8217;s democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh.  Britain, unhappy that Iran nationalized its oil industry, came up with the idea for the coup and pressed the United States to mount a joint operation to remove Mossadeqh.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

                          Following the coup, the U.S installed Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi , and the thriving democracy that existed in Iran was crushed.  The Shah led 25 years of tyrannical rule (supported by the CIA) that resulted in the killing of thousands of Iranians who opposed the U.S. puppet government.  On the economic front, the Shah denationalized Iran’s oil industry, 60% of which went to American firms.</td>

Islamic religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile and takes effective power.  Sixty-six hostages taken by students at the U.S. embassy in Tehran.  The students justified taking the hostages as retaliation for the admission of the Shah into the U.S., and demanded the Shah be returned to Iran for a trial. The new Iranian regime believed the Shah was in the U.S. so that the U.S. could carry out another coup d&#8217;etat in Iran; the U.S. claimed he had come there only to seek medical attention. The Shah was given refuge and Iranians demanded his extradition to Iran to face justice.  The U.S. rejected Iran&#8217;s request and the hostage taking ensued. The hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran lasted 444 days.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
