The average American pays [$10,489](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=4763) in &#8220;personal taxes,&#8221; representing [14%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States) of the average household&#8217;s total income. 

This [$10,489](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=4763) includes:

  * federal income taxes
  * state income taxes
  * personal property taxes
  * vehicle taxes
  * other small taxes
