### Political Labels = Intellectual Prisons

You can call me whatever you want (and people do). A liberal, a conservative, a libertarian. Just don&#8217;t call me late for dinner! The only label I&#8217;d be comfortable giving myself is [utilitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism). I think that voters basing their political decisions based on statistics instead of emotion will facilitate the minimization of suffering in the world. If my views are sometimes aligned with that of libertarian dogma, it’s because history suggests that concentration of power in the hands of a few is more likely to lead to war, oppression, and suffering generally.

But in general, political labels suck.  They only serve to divide us and pit us against each other even though we all really share the **same fundamental goal** that drives our civic life and action.  We all want to solve all the world&#8217;s problems.
